***Author: Enid Soto***

This is a content Management System for managing a company's employees. It runs in the console and requires a mySQL database.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with mySQL queries. It was an assignment of the UM Full Stack Developer Bootcamp 2019-2020.

## Technologies used

The app was built with node, inquirer, and the database was implemented with MAMP and MySQLWorkbench.

## Functionality

The app gives users a list of operations they can perform. They can view and/or create employees, roles and departments. Inquirer prompts the user for the required information, and the information is selected or written into the database through mySQL queries.
